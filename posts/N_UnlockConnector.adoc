|       | _Functional block_       | N. Unlock Connector
|*3*    | *Objective(s)*           | To remotely unlock a Connector of a Charge Point.
|*4*    | *Description*            | This use case covers how the Central System can request a Charge Point to unlock a Connector while there is no ongoing transaction. +
|       | _Actors_                 | Charge Point, Central System, Connector, External Trigger
|       | _Scenario description_   | *1.* An External Trigger triggers the Charge Point to unlock the Connector. +
                                     *2.* The Charge Point sends <<unlockconnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>> . +
                                     *3.* Upon receipt of <<unlockconnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>>, the Charge Point responds with <<unlockconnector.conf,UnlockConnector.conf>>. +
                                     *4.* The response PDU indicates whether the Charge Point was able to unlock its Connector.

|*5*    | *Prerequisite(s)*          | There is no ongoing transaction.

                                     The Charge Point was _not_ able to unlock the Connector.

|*7*    | *Error handling*         | _ConnectorLockFailure_ Failure to lock or unlock Connector. +
                                     _UnlockCommand_ Central System sent an Unlock Connector command.
|*8*    | *Remark(s)*              | An external trigger can be e.g. a Charge Point Operator or a EV Driver app. +
                                     +
                                      When trying to stop a running transaction, the Central System SHOULD use StopTransaction.req when possible. +
                                      +
                                     The purpose of this message: Help EV drivers that have problems unplugging their cable from the Charge Point in case of malfunction of the Connector cable retention. When a EV driver calls the CPO help-desk, an operator could manually trigger the sending of an <<unlockconnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>> to the Charge Point, forcing a new attempt to unlock the Connector. Hopefully this time the Connector unlocks and the EV driver can unplug the cable and drive away. +
                                     +
                                     <<unlockConnector.req,UnlockConnector.req>> is intended only for unlocking the cable retention lock on the Connector, not for unlocking a Connector access door.
